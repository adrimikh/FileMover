# FileMover

Created this mini-utility app just because I'm binge-downloading pdf files and I'm tired of seeing them in my Downloads folder, and felt it could be an occasion to practice file management in Swift and it's my first SwiftUI app (Loved UIKit btw).

# Usage
Usage is pretty intuitive, you can either copy the files to a new directory or move them in a new directory.

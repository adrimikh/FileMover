# FileMover

Created this mini-utility app just because I'm binge-downloading pdf files and I'm tired of seeing them in my Downloads folder, and felt it could be an occasion to practice file management in Swift and it's my first SwiftUI app (Loved UIKit btw).

## Usage
Usage is pretty intuitive, you choose an extension and all the files in the directory you choose are moved to a new folder, named "Extensions", in a destination directory of your choice. 
You can either move the files or copy them, there is a dedicated button for each action.
All icons and images come by the default SF Symbols pack provided by Apple.
